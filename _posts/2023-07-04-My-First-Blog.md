###### Astral projection, also known as astral travel or out-of-body experience (OBE), refers to the phenomenon where one's consciousness or spirit seemingly separates from the physical body and explores the astral plane. It is believed to be a form of non-physical travel where individuals can navigate different realms, dimensions, or planes of existence. Practitioners often induce astral projection through deep relaxation, meditation, or specific techniques. Many report vivid experiences of flying, visiting distant locations, and encountering spiritual entities during astral projection. While some view it as a metaphysical or spiritual practice, the scientific community generally considers it to be a subjective experience lacking empirical evidence.
